#TODO: main idea still holds but needs major updating. 

When Python script receives a message
  time = getsystemtime
  if time is between time1 and time2 
     append a line to File /WASymTrack/incoming.time1_time2.csv
  else 
     close file /WASymTrack/incoming.time1_time2.csv
     compress file /WASymTrack/incoming.time1_time2.csv using "tar czf ..." 
     append a line: "Ready incoming.time1_time2.csv" to file /WASymTrack/ReadyTasks
     update interval time1=time2 and time2=time2+30 mins
     create new file /WASymTrack/incoming.time1_time2.csv
     append (phone,msg,location,sound_url,time_stamp) tuple to /WASymTrack/incoming.time1_time2.csv #at least one of msg,location,sound_url is not null 

Meanwhile, a script get_last_data.sh on AUB machine Kitab does the following:
   scp file /WASymTrack/ReadyTasks 
   Compute the difference between it and between ReadyTasks_prev
   Retreive the difference files using scp diff_results
   Move ReadTasks_prev to /WASymTrack/ReadyTasks_timestamp
   Move ReadTasks to ReadTasks_prev


We set this up such that 
1. Script  get_last_data.sh runs every half an hour at day:hour:15/45 mins:00 
2. time1 and time2 in python script are setup half an hour apart at day:hour:00/30 mins:00
