  \frametitle{What is STSMM?} 
  \be
  \i Framework that collects symptoms using social media messaging
    \be 
    \i Whatsapp, \textcolor{gray}{FB-messenger, SMS, Telegram, ...} 
    \ee
  \i It receives information through dedicated contacts (phone numbers)
    \be
    \i Text messages, voice notes and locations 
    \ee
  \i Extracts symptoms from messages and saves them in a data base 
    \be
    \i Analytics on collected data provides informed decision making 
    \ee
  \i Complementary for massive testing and {\em compensatory} when that is lacking 
  \ee
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{How does it work?} 
  \be
  \i Users send their COVID-19 related symptoms daily 
    \be 
    \i Even if they are feeling Ok or have no symptoms
    \ee 
  \i Together with locations this helps track symptom evolution 
    \be 
    \i Across regions and demographies
    \ee
  \i This allows for 
    \be 
    \i Better planning 
    \i Early intervention 
    \i Micro-interventions
    \i Helps enable multicycle Lockdown-release decisions 
    \ee
  \i<2-> {\bf Requires high coverage, including users with limited internet access} 
  \ee
\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Is it useful?} 
  \be
  \i Infectious and viral disease experts at AUB think it is
extremely useful
    \be 
    \i Medical Doctors: Ummaya Msharaffie, Faek Jamali, 
                        Hala Tfaili, Elie Akl, Hussein Ismail, $\ldots$
    \i Epidemic and viral control experts: Drs Heinrich Dhone, Hassan Zaraket
    \ee 
  \i Minister of Health endorsed the idea 
  \i Adhoc COVID-19 modeling team at AUB can readily use such data if it exists
  \ee
\end{frame}


\begin{wideframe}
  \frametitle{Existing Symptom Tracker Mobile
  Applications}
  \be
  \i King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' Biomedical Research Center
     \be \i \url{https://covid.joinzoe.com} 
     \ee
  \i Apple released a CDC based COVID 19 screening tool
  \i MoPH added a symptom checker on its Health Mobile App
    \be \i Not clear if it collects data \ee 
  \i AUBMC added a symptom checker on its AUBHealth Mobile App
    \be \i Not clear if it collects data \ee 
  \i Great initiatives: however, {\bf require data package, literacy, and
  minimal mobile application literacy}
  \ee
\end{wideframe}

\begin{wideframe}
  \frametitle{Limitations of the Mobile Application Approach} 
  \be
  \i A good majority has limited data packages
  \be \i  For example 500 MB of WhatsApp use for 4 USD monthly \ee 
\i  A good majority is Mobile App illiterate
\be 
\i  They do not know how to install and use a Mobile App and depend on
mobile service stores to do so even for minimal issues
\ee 
\i  A good majority use WhatsApp as a cheaper telephone alternative
\be \i  Conversations and recorded notes \ee 
\i  A significant majority is illiterate
  \ee

  \frametitle{One Use: Lockdown-release cycles} 
  \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth,height=5.7cm]{jpgs/lockdown_release}

  \be
  \i Implementing these cycles may be necessary to manage future outbreaks
  \i We need tools to more accurately predict
    \be \i Titrated lockdown release and Reinstate lockdown thresholds \ee 
  \ee
\end{wideframe} 




\begin{wideframe}
  \frametitle{WhatsApp based Symptom Tracker (WaSyT)} 

  \be
  \i Dedicate WhatsApp enabled phone numbers: WhatsApp Robots (WaBots)
  \be \i Similar to the World Health Organization information WhatsApp bot
      \i We only need the receiving end
      \ee 
  \i Automate receiving text and voice messages through WaBots
  \be \i The messages get decoded and saved into a database
      \i The database entries relate users, locations and symptoms across time
      \ee
  \i Analyze symptom evolution across areas and recommend interventions
  \ee

\begin{wideframe}
  \frametitle{How can this be done?}
  \be
  \i Gateway to collect messages 
    \be \i Alternative 1: WhatsApp business API
        \i Alternative 2: Chrome browser extensions over \url{web.whatsapp.com} 
    \ee
  \i Speech to text 
    \be \i Alternative 1: existing Arabic Speech recognition system 
        \be \i RDI and QCRI exist for general purpose text 
        \ee 
        \i Alternative 2: Signal processing for keyword spotting 
        \be \i More accurate but requires time for data collection and development 
        \ee
    \ee
  \i Symptom extraction from text messages 
    \be \i Natural language processing based on bag of words augmentation for each symptom
    \ee 
  \i Analytics: readily available with AUB AdHoc COVID-19 modeling team
  \ee

  \frametitle{Example messages } 
  \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth,height=5.7cm]{jpgs/examples} 

  Each message will be decoded into a database entry, 
  related to the source phone number and its location

  \frametitle{Status so far} 
  \be 
  \i 90\% work functional prototype
  \i Gateway is provided by \url{CM.com} and we implemented server to integrate with their API
    \be 
    \i We have two weeks free trial 
    \i Underway work to build alternative: chrome extension
    \ee
  \i Speech to text is provided by \url{RDI-ai.com} and we implemented scripts to integrate with their solution
    \be \i We have two weeks free trial 
        \i Underway work to build alternative with QCRI data set and Kaldi 
        \i May explore CMUSphinx for keyword spotting as well 
    \ee
  \i Symptom extraction from text: almost complete
  \i Integration: almost complete 
  \i Collected Arabic voice data sets of symptoms 
    \be \i 500 sentences each with Male/Female voices 
        \i Annotated at sentence level 
    \ee
  \ee 
\end{wideframe} 


\begin{wideframe}
  \frametitle{Final notes } 
  \be 
  \i Need a good tutorial and promotion campaign for people to use this once done
  \i In addition to WhatsApp, we recommend the symptom tracker to be a standalone application
  \i Do we still need to do massive testing if we do this?
  \be \i This is complementary wider scale control measure if massive testing is implemented
      \i Compensatory measure when massive testing is lacking
      \ee
